Certainly! Let's work through a simple example using sample data to understand the PARTITION BY clause and when it can be used effectively.

Consider the following sample data in a hypothetical "Sales" table:

sales_id	product_id	category	sales_amount
1	101	                    A	200
2	102	                    B	150
3	103	                    A	300
4	104	                    B	180
5	105	                    A	250
Now, let's say we want to calculate the average sales amount for each product category and show the average along with each sale's details.


SELECT
    sales_id,
    product_id,
    category,
    sales_amount,
    AVG(sales_amount) OVER(PARTITION BY category) AS avg_category_sales
FROM
    Sales;

In this example:

The PARTITION BY clause is used with the AVG() window function. It divides the data into partitions based on the category column. This means that rows with the same category value will be considered together in their own partition.

The AVG(sales_amount) OVER(PARTITION BY category) calculates the average sales amount within each partition (each category). It's like calculating the average sales amount for all rows that have the same category.

The result would look like this:

sales_id	product_id	category	sales_amount	avg_category_sales
1	101	A	200	250
2	102	B	150	165
3	103	A	300	250
4	104	B	180	165
5	105	A	250	250





RANK() with partition by():

Certainly! Let's dive into an example that uses the RANK() function with the PARTITION BY clause to better understand its usage.

Consider a hypothetical "Students" table with the following columns: student_id, class_id, score.

student_id	class_id	score
1	A	85
2	A	92
3	B	78
4	A	88
5	B	95
6	B	82
Let's say you want to rank students within each class based on their scores. You want to show each student's details along with their rank within their respective classes.

SELECT
    student_id,
    class_id,
    score,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY class_id ORDER BY score DESC) AS class_rank
FROM
    Students;
In this example:

The PARTITION BY clause is used with the RANK() window function. It divides the data into partitions based on the class_id column. This means that rows with the same class_id value will be ranked separately within their own partition.

The RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY class_id ORDER BY score DESC) calculates the rank of each student's score within their respective class partition. The ORDER BY score DESC orders the scores in descending order within each partition.

The result would look like this:

student_id	class_id	score	class_rank
2	A	92	1
4	A	88	2
1	A	85	3
5	B	95	1
6	B	82	2
3	B	78	3
